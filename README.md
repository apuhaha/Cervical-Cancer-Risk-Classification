# Cervical-Cancer-Risk-Classification
### About
   To meet the challenge of the increasing types of disease in this modern era, technology plays a very important role in health research.
 Women's health has become a major concern because of the increasing rates of cervical cancer because it can be a deadly disease.
 The cervical tumor is one of the far-reaching sicknesses among ladies in India and around the world. Early analysis is good for better
 treatment, yet due to vulnerability in detecting cancer cells becoming complex.

   Machine Learning (ML) systems can be used to create tools for doctors in the conclusion of cervical growth, which will enormously upgrade the survival rate of patients.
       
AIM:
        The objective of this project is to perform data analysis on the given datset, and classify the data on four target variables.
        
### Dataset:
   The dataset has attribute columns that determine the risk of having cervical cancer. The dataset has 858 rows and 36 columns.
   The attributes are-                  
   * Age                                    * Number of sexual partners                    * First sexual intercourse 
   * Num of pregnancies                     * Smokes                                       * Smokes (years)
   * Smokes (packs/year)                    * Hormonal Contraceptives                      * Hormonal Contraceptives (years)
   * IUD                                    * IUD (years)                                  * STDs
   * STDs (number)                          * STDs:condylomatosis                          * STDs:cervical condylomatosis
   * STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis     * STDs:vaginal condylomatosis                  * STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis
   * STDs:syphilis                          * STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease             * STDs:genital herpes
   * STDs:molluscum contagiosum             * STDs:AIDS                                    * STDs:HIV
   * STDs:Hepatitis B                       * STDs:HPV                                     * STDs: Number of diagnosis
   * STDs: Time since first diagnosis       * STDs: Time since last diagnosis              * Dx:Cancer
   * Dx:CIN                                 * Dx:HPV

### CONCLUSION:
    
   * For convinience, the dataframe was separated into numerical, categorical and category data. 
   * Univariate Analysis was performed. It is seen that Hormonal Contraceptives play an important role in deciding the risk of cervical cancer; while 'STDs:cervical       condylomatosis','STDs:AIDS' do not appear of much significance.
   * We observe that in general, as the age increases, the number of sexual partners increases, which leads to more risk of cervical cancer.
   * For increase in the number of pregnancies, the risk of cancer seems to have increased.
   * Use of Hormonal Contraceptives over the years increases the risk of cancer, mostly results in Schiller test turning out to be positive.
   * Based on the distribution of data points in the scatter plot of category vs Smokes, the Schiller and Biopsy tests are showing that women who are smoking for more than 5 years are having more chances of getting the cancer.
   * Most women have been on the IUD for 3 years. 
   * Most women have had 1 or 2 STDs. 
   * The mean age of women having risk of cancer is 27.

     Thus we can conclude that the women who use Hormonal Contraceptives, have more sexual partners, and have been smoking for more years have more risk of cervical cancer.
